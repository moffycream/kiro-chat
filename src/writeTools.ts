 *
 * - `observeToolPaths` snapshots the file so the edit can be reviewed.
 * - `askPermission` skips the approval prompt for edits, because the review
 *   diff is about to ask the same question. Asking twice for one edit is the
 *   thing that made the flow feel wrong.
 *
 * Free of any `vscode` import so it can be exercised on its own — see
 * `test/writeTools.test.js`.
